# simpleATMApp
C++ Console App I did while bored. Quite unprofessional but working nonetheless.

It has a method of storing PINs and money on the account using text files. You can check your balance, take money, add money and create an new account.
Right now it should work only on Windows(atleast from what I know, I can't test them out on other OS) because of the usage of the library stdlib.h to clean the pause the console.
